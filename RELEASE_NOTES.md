# Release Notes

SwiftUI support is currently an `experimental feature`, where I use this separate library to find a good fit with the main library. To be able to move swiftly (pun intended) and not get stuck with a bunch of deprecations and migrations, I will allow breaking changes between minor versions.

In `v4.0`, this library will become a part of the main library. After that, semver will apply to the SwiftUI parts as well. 


## 3.6.4

This release fixes some bugs:

* The `SystemKeyboardDimensions` incorrectly set the spacebar to 50% of the width. It not takes the remaining space, which is not perfect, but better.
* On iOS 13.3 and below, button texts were autoshrinked to 0.1 even if they didn't have to be.



## 3.6.3

This release adds some things for the future:

* `KeyboardButtonWidth` is a new way to express the width of a keyboard button.
* `View+KeyboardButtonWidth` is a new way to apply a width to a keyboard button.

Although not used by the standard keyboards yet, I still wanted to add them before starting working on 4.0.


## 3.6.2

This release rolls back some changes to try improve dark appearance keyboards in SwiftUI, since it negatively affected light appearance text field keyboards.

Turns out dark appearance can't be detected in keyboard extensions, neither in UIKit or SwiftUI.

See more in [this video](https://twitter.com/danielsaidi/status/1353600933222109186?s=20).


## 3.6.1

This release fixes so that `CalloutCurve` and `CustomRoundedRect` handles invalid rects.


## 3.6

### New features

* `AutocompleteToolbar` has a new, static  `standardReplacement` function.
* `AutocompleteToolbar` has a new, static  `standardReplacementAction` function.
* `AutocompleteToolbar` now lets you provide an optional, custom  `replacementAction` in init.
* `Color+Resources` is a new extension that provides asset-based colors that adapt to dark mode.
* `EmojiCategoryKeyboard` is a new view that lists the emojis of a selected category and a menu.
* `EmojiCategoryKeyboardMenu` is a new view that lets the user select one of multiple categories.
* `EmojiKeyboard` is a new view that renders a set of emojis in a lazy grid. The item action is customizable.

### Behavior changes

* `Color+Button` uses the new asset-based colors.
* `SystemKeyboardButtonBody` now only offsets small caps texts.
* Due to a secondary callout action bug, the secondary context is now created by the vc.

### Deprecations

* Some button-specific `Color` extensions have been deprecated.
* `View+keyboardAction(:context:)` has been deprecated. 


## 3.5.2

This release fixes so that the secondary input gesture triggers a tap if there were no secondary actions in the callout.

The release also makes the entire autocomplete button tappable, instead of just the text.


## 3.5.1

This release fixes so that upper-cased chars gets secondary callout actions and that the input callout isn't dismissed if there are no secondary actions.


## 3.5

This release deprecates some `system` properties in favor of the `standard` naming concept.

In most cases, the system behavior *is* the standard behavior.

### New features

* `SystemKeyboardButtonContent` is new view that extracts content logic from `SystemKeyboardButton`.
* `SystemKeyboardButtonRowItem` can now be created with generic views. 
* `SystemKeyboardSpaceButton` is new view that wraps `SystemKeyboardSpaceButtonContent` and applied a style and gestures to it.
* `SystemKeyboardSpaceButtonContent` is new view that animates between a locale text and a space text.

### Behavior changes

* `SystemKeyboard` now wraps the `buttonBuilder` generated views in a `SystemKeyboardButtonRowItem`.
* `SystemKeyboardButton` now applies a fallback text from the new appearance provider.
* The standard `SystemKeyboard` button builder generates `SystemKeyboardButtonContent` instead of `SystemKeyboardButton`.

### Deprecations

* `Color+systemKeyboardButtonBackgroundColorDark` has been renamed to `standardDarkButtonBackgroundColor` 
* `Color+systemKeyboardButtonBackgroundColorLight` has been renamed to `standardLightButtonBackgroundColor` 
* `Color+systemKeyboardButtonForegroundColor` has been renamed to `standardButtonForegroundColor` 
* `Color+systemKeyboardButtonShadowColor` has been renamed to `standardButtonShadowColor`
* `KeyboardAction+systemKeyboardButtonBackgroundColor` has been renamed to `standardButtonBackgroundColor` 
* `KeyboardAction+systemKeyboardButtonImage` has been renamed to `standardButtonImage` 
* `KeyboardAction+systemKeyboardButtonShadowColor` has been renamed to `standardButtonShadowColor`
* `KeyboardShiftState+systemImage` has been renamed to `standardButtonImage`
* `KeyboardShiftState+systemKeyboardButtonImage` was unused and has been deprecated.
* `KeyboardType+systemKeyboardButtonImage` has been renamed to `standardButtonImage`
* `View+systemKeyboardButtonStyle` has been renamed to `standardButtonStyle`
* `View+systemKeyboardButtonBackground` has been renamed to `standardButtonBackground`
* `View+systemKeyboardButtonFont` has been renamed to `standardButtonFont`
* `View+systemKeyboardButtonForeground` has been renamed to `standardButtonForeground`
* `View+systemKeyboardButtonShadow` has been renamed to `standardButtonShadow`

### Breaking changes

* `AutocompleteToolbar` now uses `AutocompleteSuggestion` instead of `String`. It makes it much more powerful, so I hope this breaking change is acceptable.
* `SystemKeyboardButtonRowItem` has been made generic.
* `SystemKeyboard.ButtonBuilder` now returns an `AnyView` since you may want to use any custom view for any button.


## 3.4.2

This release adds curves and behavior changes to the callout bubbles.

### New features

* `CalloutCurve` is a new shape that can be used to smoothen the two parts of a callout bubble.

### Behavior changes

* `CalloutStyle` now applies button frame insets when configured for a system keyboard.
* `InputCallout` has curves between the button area and the callout.
* `InputCalloutContext` has a new `isEnabled` property that is only true for phones, since it should not be displayed on iPads.
* `InputCalloutContext` no longer insets the button rect.
* `SecondaryInputCallout` has curves between the button area and the callout and the design is improved.
* `SystemInputCalloutContext` no longer insets the button rect.


## 3.4.1

This release fixes some visual artefacts in the callout bubbles.


## 3.4

This release adds support for input callouts and secondary input callouts.

### New features

This release has new features for callouts.

* `CalloutStyle` is a shared style for keyboard button callout.
* `InputCallout` is a callout that can highlight the currently pressed keyboard button.
* `InputCalloutContext` can be used to control `InputCallout` views.
* `InputCalloutStyle` can be used to style `InputCallout` views.
* `SecondaryInputCallout` is a callout that can present secondary actions for the currently pressed keyboard button.
* `SecondaryInputCalloutContext` can be used to control `SecondaryInputCallout` views.
* `SecondaryInputCalloutStyle` can be used to style `SecondaryInputCallout` views.
* `View+InputCallout` can be used to wrap any view in a `ZStack` with a topmost `InputCallout`
* `View+SecondaryInputCallout` can be used to wrap any view in a `ZStack` with a topmost `SecondaryInputCallout`

### Behavior changes

* `View+KeyboardGestures` has been extended with gestures for `InputCallout` and `SecondaryInputCallout`.

### Breaking changes

This release has breaking changes to experimental features.

* `ObservableKeyboardContext` `keyboardInputProvider` has been renamed to `keyboardInputSetProvider`



## 3.3

This release contains a lot of changes in the main library.

In this library, the observable context has received a `keyboardBehavior` property and the dismiss keyboard action has an icon. 


## 3.2

This release contains layout improvements and breaking changes.

* There is a new `SystemKeyboard` that takes a keyboard layout and renders it as button rows. 
* `SystemKeyboard` is more flexible than the previous keyboards, which have been removed.
* `SystemKeyboardDimensions` is a new struct that replaces the previous `SystemKeyboardStyle`.

The new input set and keyboard layout capabilities make it easier than ever to create keyboards.

### Breaking changes

The following views and extensions have been removed and replaced with `SystemKeyboard`:

* `AlphabeticSystemKeyboard`
* `NumericSystemKeyboard`
* `SymbolicSystemKeyboard`
* `SystemKeyboardBottomRow`
* `SystemKeyboardButtonRow`
* `SystemKeyboardStyle`
* `SystemKeyboardVStack`
* `View+systemKeyboardButtonCornerRadius`
* `View+systemKeyboardButtonFrame`

Even though much is removed, I hope that this makes it a lot easier to create systme keyboards in SwiftUI.


## 3.1.3

This version fixes a bug where the long press action of a `KeyboardImageButton` didn't do anything.


## 3.1.2

This version makes the `View+Geometry` extension internal.

If you use it, consider copying it from [SwiftUIKit](https://github.com/danielsaidi/SwiftUIKit).


## 3.1.1

This version makes the `.emojiCategory` action use a clear interactable background for system buttons.


## 3.1

This version adds new autocomplete tools:

* `ObservableAutocompleteContext` can be used to bind autocomplete results to views.
* `AutocompleteToolbar` is a customizable toolbar for displaying autocomplete results.

The toolbar uses the new observable context to populate itself with suggestions.


## 3.0.3

This version improves the documentation and adds more configuration options to some views.


## 3.0.2

This version improves the documentation and fixes an invalid package reference.


## 3.0.1

This version fixes a bug where the demo keyboard globe button didn't do anything.

This version also adjusts the font weight of system button images.


## 3.0

This version adds a bunch of extended iOS13/SwiftUI/Combine-specific logic.

There are a lot more not covered in these release notes or in the readme, but I've tried to apply most things in the demo.

* `ObservableKeyboardContext` contains more information.
* `Image+Keyboard` contains more keyboard-specific icons. 
* `KeyboardGridRow` has been deleted and replaced with an `HStack`.
* `KeyboardSetting` can resolve a unique key for an `Identifiable` context.
* `PersistedKeyboardSetting` can resolve a unique key for an `Identifiable` context.

The new `Gestures` and `System` namespace help you build native-imitating keyboards:

* `View+keyboardAction` applies keyboard action-specific gestures to any view.
* `View+keyboardGestures` applies keyboard-specific gestures to any view.
* The various `+system` extensions apply a system keyboard logic to various types.

* You can also use the many extensions within these namespaces to build custom views.

There are new `System` mimicking keyboard views:

* `SystemKeyboardBottomRow` mimics the bottommost row in a system keyboard.
* `SystemKeyboardButton` mimics a system keyboard button.
* `SystemKeyboardButtonRow` mimics a row in a system keyboard.
* `SystemKeyboardStyle` defines a style for system keyboards.
* `SystemKeyboardVStack` is a VStack that applies the correct system keyboard style.
* `AlphabeticSystemKeyboard` mimics an alphabetical system keyboard.
* `NumericSystemKeyboard` mimics a numeric system keyboard.
* `SymbolicSystemKeyboard` mimics a symbolic system keyboard.

There is a new `Toast` namespace that contains utils to show toast messages above a keyboard. 

Breaking changes:
* `View` `withClearInteractableBackground` has been renamed to `clearInteractableBackground`. 


## 2.9.0 - 2.7.2

This version updates external dependencies to their latest versions.


## 2.7

This version adds the very first (and so far limited) support for `SwiftUI`. Many new features are iOS 13-specific.

There are some new views that can be used in SwiftUI-based apps and keyboard extensions:

* `KeyboardGrid` distributes actions evenly within a grid.
* `KeyboardGridRow` is used for each row in the grid.
* `KeyboardHostingController` can be used to wrap any `View` in a keyboard extension.
* `KeyboardImageButton` view lets you show an `.image` action or `Image` in a `Button`.
* `NextKeyboardButton` sets itself up with a `globe` icon and works as a standard "next keyboard" button.
* `PersistedKeyboardSetting` is a new property wrapper for persisting settings in `UserDefaults`. 

* `Color.clearInteractable` can be used instead of `.clear` to allow gestures to be detected.
* `Image.globe` returns the icon that is used for "next keyboard".
* `KeyboardInputViewController` `setup(with:View)`  sets up a `KeyboardHostingController`.
* `View` `withClearInteractableBackground()` can be used to make an entire view interactable.
